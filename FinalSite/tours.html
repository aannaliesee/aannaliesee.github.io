        <p>Here are some stops on our island that you may want to visit with your scooter or jeep. There are many hidden gems, so don't feel the need to visit only well known attractions.</p>

                <img src="/FinalSite/images/Rsanta.jpg" alt="santatosawall">
                <li>Santa Rosa Wall</li>
                <p>One of my favorite spots in Cozumel, Santa Rosa Wall kind of has it all with healthy reef that goes down as deep as you're willing to venture (we typically hang around 70-80 ft.) and some really cool swim throughs! The dive ends on the sand where we've been lucky enough to catch rays and larger fish like grouper hanging out waiting to put a finale on what is always an enjoyable dive. A must when diving Cozumel!</p>
                <img src="/FinalSite/images/Recoreserve.jpg" alt="ecologicalreserve">

                <li>Playa de San Martin</li>
                <p>Lovely white sand that stretch on for ages. There is a beach bar on the other side of the road with a few tourist stalls and washrooms. We were warned of the current, but the waves were nice</p>
                <img src="/FinalSite/images/Rmirador.jpg" alt="elmirador">
                <li>El Mirador</li>
                <p>Gorgeous spot. We went at sunset and watched the sun go down while enjoying the power of the waves. Very tranquil part of the island.</p>
