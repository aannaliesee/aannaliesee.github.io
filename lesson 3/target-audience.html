    <h2>Scenarios</h2>
    <p>I want to go swimming in my local outdoor pool but it looks stormy outside. 
        If it rains, will there lightning? </p>

    <p> I am going to compete in a cycling race that will last all day. 
        What clothes should I bring to be prepared? </p>
        
    <p>I have asthma and need updated every morning to know if I should 
        wear a mask or not. Even with asthma, I also like to go for long morning walks. 
        How smoky is it outside? </p>
        
    <p>I love golfing but don’t want to practice my golf swing with wind 
        being a factor. When will the wind die down?</p>
        
    <p> My bike is chained up outside by my apartment. 
        Should I bring it inside so it doesn’t get weathered? </p>
        
    <p>I want to go surfing but am worried that it will be 
        too cold because we are going into winter. Is 6am too cold to go surfing? </p>
