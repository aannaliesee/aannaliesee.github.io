        <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
        <p>  Nikon <br>

            Visual hierarchy creates a pattern of attention to certain objects on a page. For this Nikon homepage, 
            the camera lense is what first catches your eye, then the "Dreams defined" heading, then the images, and so on. 
            This is a great example of controlling what the viewer's eyes see first. The lense is bold and center followed by 
            smaller objects that are not as obvious.

        <h2>Parc:Repetition</h2>
        <p> ThredUp  <br>

        <p>
            ThredUp is an online clothing thrift store and advertise sales a lot. 
            Here they used the element of repetition to be organized and eye-catching. Repetition looks clean and modern. 
            They use a lot of this same sized circle throughout their page as well as the same two colors to create
            a repetitious pattern.

        <p>
            This website is a free image source where you can find almost any royalty-free picture. It is very minimal and clean. 
            There is plenty of white space and all the colors are neutral which creates a clean look. The white space allows for viewers to focus on the images
            without being overwhelmed.
